This research focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to climate change prediction and environmental modeling. We are particularly interested in methods that leverage satellite imagery, remote sensing data, and time-series analysis for temperature forecasting, precipitation prediction, and extreme weather event detection. Key areas include ensemble modeling approaches, neural networks for climate data, and interpretable AI methods that can help understand climate dynamics. We also consider work on uncertainty quantification in climate models and the integration of physics-informed machine learning approaches.
